# 🚀 Contribution Guide | Galaxy Smart Wallet

Welcome to **Galaxy Smart Wallet**! This guide will help you collaborate efficiently on our project. By following these conventions, we ensure the codebase stays clear and organized, making reviews and development smoother for everyone.

---

## 🛠️ The Basics

Before you start contributing, here are some key guidelines:

- **Use lowercase for branch names and commit messages**: Keeps everything uniform.
- **Keep commit messages short and clear**: If a commit requires a lot of explanation, consider breaking it down.
- **Limit commit titles to 72 characters**: Use the extended description for additional details if needed.
- **One commit, one purpose**: Group related changes into a single commit. For unrelated changes, create separate commits.

## 🌳 Branch Naming: Clear and Consistent

Use the following structure to name branches, so everyone can understand their purpose at a glance:

**Format:**
```
<prefix>/<short-description>
```

### 🔹 Main Prefixes:
- **feat/** – For new features.
- **fix/** – For bug fixes.
- **remove/** – For removing files or features.
- **docs/** – For documentation updates.
- **style/** – For visual or formatting changes (no logic adjustments).
- **refactor/** – For restructuring code without changing functionality.
- **perf/** – For performance improvements.
- **test/** – For adding or updating tests.
- **build/** – For changes to the build system or dependencies.
- **ci/** – For continuous integration changes.
- **chore/** – For maintenance and routine tasks.

### 📌 Example Branch Names:
```
feat/user-authentication
fix/cart-error
docs/api-endpoints
style/navbar-icons
```

## ✍️ Writing Effective Commits

Keep your commit messages meaningful and clear to help others understand your changes.

### ✅ Commit Format:
```
<type>: <what you did>
```

### 🔹 Main Types:
- **feat** – For new features.
- **fix** – For bug fixes.
- **docs** – For documentation updates.
- **style** – For formatting or appearance changes.
- **refactor** – For code restructuring without changing functionality.
- **perf** – For performance optimizations.
- **test** – For adding or updating tests.
- **build** – For dependency or build tool updates.
- **ci** – For CI/CD changes.
- **chore** – For maintenance tasks.
- **update** – For non-functional changes or minor improvements.

### 🔥 Key Commit Rules:
- **Be clear and direct**: Write commits that explain exactly what was done.
- **Use present tense**: "add email validation" instead of "added email validation".
- **Avoid temporary or unclear commits**: Keep incomplete work in a local branch or create a draft PR if necessary.

### 📌 Example Commit Messages:
```
feat: implement product search
fix: resolve payment form validation
docs: update API sections
style: adjust margins on header
```
